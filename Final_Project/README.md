The Jupyter Notebook shows the data vizualizations, but the Selection interaction will not work without a bokeh server running.

To deploy: download NCooper_DATA608_Final_Deployment.py

cd to directory containing the script.

In command line: >bokeh serve --show NCooper_DATA608_Final_Deployment.py

The data vizualzation will pop up in web browser and the select funtion will work.
