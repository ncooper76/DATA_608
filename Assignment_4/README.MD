In this assigment, I take data from:
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/nwxe-4ae8.json
which is a database of street trees in NYC
and create a Dash App that allows the user to select a Borough of NYC
or the number of Stewards per tree. An Histogram will then show the
distrubution of health of the trees in three catagories:
Poor, Fair, or Good
